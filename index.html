      <p><em>In Process of becoming a <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elias-a-fuentes-9695b6b7">Web Developer</a></strong></em></p>
      <p>I am currently learning web development as a self taught student. I love to play video games and explore new places I haven't been to. My goal is to study full time in web development and have enough knowledge and skills in the next three to four months to be able to apply for a job in web development. I have quit my previous full time job as an accounts receivable technician to pursue becoming a web developer. I am very interested in this field and I look forward to making it my full time career in the future.</p>
